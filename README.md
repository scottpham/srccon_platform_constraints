# Platform Constraints

If you make interactive graphics for a living, the number and variety of platforms you have to publish for can be a little intimidating. Working with your news org's CMS is probably hard enough, but now you've got weird stuff like Facebook Instant Articles and Google Amp to think about. How do you address all these platforms and keep sane? And when is the right time to just say no?

This repo is part of a session made by [Dan Wood](https://github.com/DanielJWood) and [Scott Pham](https://github.com/scottpham) for the [2016 SRCCON](http://srccon.org/) conference in Portland, Oregon.

## Platforms
Your newsroom may or may not be on this unexhaustive list of platforms, but let's think about how we may or may not tackle them. If we don't, think about why and how we communicate that
- Your CMS
- Static pages (apps.yournewsroom.com)
- Mobile browser
- Facebook Instant Articles
- Google Amp
- Social/Email Newsletter

## The Plan

1. Mini activity
2. Group breakout
3. Discussion

## Mini Activity
Which platforms give you the biggest headaches? Whether it's because of technical difficulties, design challenges or whatever, let us know.

## Breakout
Your ability to power through platform constraints depends a lot on time and team size. We're going to break into groups and think about how to tell a story with data and graphics given a set of arbitrary constraints. 

* [Download the data excerpt](https://github.com/scottpham/srccon_platform_constraints/blob/master/co2.xlsx?raw=true) or if you're enterprising, pull out other stats from the larger report (like population, GDP, emissions by sector), found [here](http://www.iea.org/media/freepublications/stats/CO2Highlights2015tables.xls).

Think about what kind of content you'll produce for each platform. Think about whether your content will translate easily between different platforms, or if you'll make pieces unique for the platform. If you decline to build something for a particular platform, think about why and how you'll communicate that to your newsroom.
